## Project Goals

This is my first project, and I'm excited to dive into the world of data analytics and machine learning! While this project is beginner-level and a common machine learning exercise, 
it's an excellent starting point for me to learn Python, explore data analysis techniques, and build a practical machine learning model.

## Stay Tuned for Updates!

I'll be working on this project over the coming weeks, and I'll keep this README updated with my progress and findings. Stay tuned!
